│   ├── bootstrap-essentials.css.map
│   ├── bootstrap-essentials.min.css
│   └── bootstrap-essentials.min.css.map
└── js/
    ├── bootstrap-essentials.js
    └── bootstrap-essentials.min.js
   </code></pre>
					</figure>
					<p>Place the included css and js files along with <code>bootstrap.css</code> and <code>bootstap.js</code>. We provide compiled
						CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap-essentials.*</code>), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (<code>bootstrap-essentials.min.*</code>).
						CSS <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors">source maps</a> (<code>bootstrap-essentials.*.map</code>)
						are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools.</p>
					<h2 id="whats-included-source">Bootstrap Essentials source code</h2>
					<p>The Bootstrap Essentials source code download includes the precompiled CSS and JavaScript, along with source SCSS and

</code></pre>
					</figure>
					<p>The <code>scss/</code> and <code>js/</code> are the source code for our CSS and JS (respectively). The <code>dist/</code>						folder includes everything listed in the precompiled download section above. The <code>docs/</code> folder includes
						the source code for our documentation, and <code>examples/</code> of Bootstrap usage. Beyond that, any other included
