  <p>Align nav links, forms, buttons, or text, using the <code>.navbar-left</code> or <code>.navbar-right</code> utility classes. Both classes will add a CSS float in the specified direction. For example, to align nav links, put them in a separate <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with the respective utility class applied.</p>
  <p>These classes are mixin-ed versions of <code>.pull-left</code> and <code>.pull-right</code>, but they're scoped to media queries for easier handling of navbar components across device sizes.</p>
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="callout-navbar-right-align">
    <h4>Right aligning multiple components</h4>
    <p>Navbars currently have a limitation with multiple <code>.navbar-right</code> classes. To properly space content, we use negative margin on the last <code>.navbar-right</code> element. When there are multiple elements using that class, these margins don't work as intended.</p>
    <p>We'll revisit this when we can rewrite that component in v4.</p>
